ABC's popular TV show The Bachelor garners millions of viewers each week.  Even under the guise of \"reality\" and \"true love\", we hypothesize that there exist underlying patterns that in general enhance a contestant's chance of winning.  To simulate this \"game of love\", we create a dynamic model that is updated each week of the competition that predicts contestant's chance of winning.\r\n\r\n\r\n#Background\r\n\r\nThe Bachelor is a competition based reality TV show. Each season, about 30 women vie for a wedding proposal of a single Bachelor. Each week several women are eliminated until one contestant wins. To determine which contestants stay and which are eliminated, each week the Bachelor selects only a few contestant's to accompany him on a one-on-one or group date. At the end of the episode, there is a cocktail party where the Bachelor meets with any contestants who were not given a date during the episode. Finally, the episode closes with a rose ceremony where the Bachelor chooses who will proceed to the next episode by extending to them a rose.\r\n\r\n\r\n#Objective\r\n\r\nWe analyze underlying features of all winning and losing contestants on the The Bachelor. Using these data, we build a statistical model to predict week-by-week success on the TV show.\r\n\r\nApproach Source ABC.com\r\n\r\n##Data Sources:\r\n\r\nWikipedia: A scrape of Wikipedia provided us fundamental contestant data, specifically each contestant's age, hometown, and profession. Secondly, we scraped data pertinent to the competition aspect of the TV show, which tell us whether for a given week a\r\ncontestant received a one-on-one date, a group date, or a \"won\" a group date by receiving an early rose.\r\n\r\nTwitter: We ran several searches around the airdate of each episode of The Bachelor to retrieve all tweets that pertained to a particular contestant for a particular episode. \r\n\r\nStudio photographs: Using the Wayback Machine, we scraped ABC's website to retrieve all studio photographs of each contestant of The Bachelor.\r\n\r\n##Models: \r\n\r\nLogistic Regression: We only have complete datasets (Wikipedia + Twitter + Photographs) for Seasons 13-19 of The Bachelor. For these seasons, we fit a unique logistic classifier to predict their probability of advancing to the next round. We use the following features in the prediction model:\r\n\r\n\r\n Features in Logistic Classifier\r\n Age Difference from Bachelor\r\n Hometown Distance from Bachelor's Hometown\r\n Hometown FCC Region\r\n Profession Type\r\n Twitter Sentiment from Previous Week\r\n Percentage of all Tweets from Previous Week\r\n Received a Group Date in Previous Week\r\n Won Group Date in Previous Week\r\n Received a One-on-One Date in Previous Week\r\n PCA of Face\r\n\r\n\r\nEach week a new logistic classifier was fit to the data. We used a 70% testing/training split of the data, and optimized the model using L-1 or a \"LASSO\" penalty. Each classifier's optimal hyper-parameter was optimized using a grid search cross validation.\r\n\r\n\r\n#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\r\n\r\n\r\n##Hometowns: \r\n\r\nWe expected that contestants would have better chances if they were from hometowns near the Bachelor's.  The plot below shows each contestants' hometown, the bachelors' hometowns, and the winning contestant's hometown, for each Season.  (We did not include Hawaii or Alaska because there were no contestants or bachelors from those states.)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThere is no pattern apparent in the plots above.  Sometimes the Bachelors preferred Contestants from nearby hometowns (Seasons 13 and 14), but often, they did not (Seasons 16 and 18).  \r\n\r\n\r\n##Clustering of Geographic Regions: \r\n\r\nWe considered whether FCC hometown regions were more effective predictor variables for winning contestants than hometowns.  These groupings reflect economic, and perhaps cultural, similarities. We thought that perhaps a Bachelor from a particular FCC economic area would have more in common with a Contestant from the same area.  \r\n\r\nThe plot on the left below shows the FCC economic area groupings.  The plot on the right shows the distribution of contestants in those groupings for Season 15.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Age:\r\n\r\nAdd a histogram of all contestants' ages, and a histogram of just winners' ages.\r\n\r\n##Clustering by Profession:\r\n\r\nWe used the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) to cluster each contestant by their profession. We performed this clustering by doing approximate matching of each contestant's given profession to a list of ISCO occupations. A contestant was classified according to whichever category gave the most matches to a contestant's profession. Below we plot a bar chart which shows the distribution over seasons 13-19 of the contestants' different ISCO profession types. In blue we plot the distribution of the winners. We see that most contestants fall in the Managers, Professionals, Technicians, and Service industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Tweets: \r\n\r\nTwitter Sentiment: For each episode for each contestant, we look at all tweets. Using Python's natural language processing toolkit (NLTK), we extract all the adjectives + adverbs from each tweet. We then take advantage of a sentiment analysis done on a corpus from movie reviews and tweets provided through an API at text-processing.com. Then for each tweet, we compute it's positivity probability based on the average positivity of all its adjectives and adverbs. Below are examples of positive (top) and negative (bottom) tweets for the contestant Clare (Season 18) during the episode that aired on February 3rd. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwitter Share: In addition to sentiment, we recorded the total number of tweets that a contestant received per episode, and then computed the percentage of contestant to total tweets per episode.  \r\n\r\nBelow we plot the share of tweets per episode, with each line colored by the contestant. If a contestant's twitter share was zero, we eliminate it from the plot.\r\n\r\nWe start with Season 15, where winner Emily (red line) had the most tweets throughout the season.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe plot below shows tweets for Season 16.  Courtney (light orange line) won, and Lindzi (aqua line) was the runner-up.  We also note Nicki's (dark orange) tweet share dramatically increased after week 6.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe plot below, of Season 17, shows that the winner, Catherine (purple line) had a consistently large number of tweets.  Runner-up Lindsay (blue line) and AshLee (pink), who also almost won, had significant tweet share as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also note that these plots omit contestants who never received any tweets. Thus, although our exploratory analysis shows that tweet share seems to scale with longevity on the show, twitter share may also be a binary indicator in future predictions. Put another way, any twitter activity may help a contestant's chances of surviving the next episode.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Photographs:\r\n\r\nFor seasons 13-19 of The Bachelor, studio photographs were taken prior to the competition in front of a semi-uniform blue background. We import each of these photos and convert them to greyscale. We also want to align them onto a similar grid so that image decomposition is as uniform as possible. Below we show a few results from our importing, and rescaling process:\r\n\r\n\r\nSample of Cropped Images used in Photo Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe then decompose each photo into its first 10 principal components (see example below):\r\n\r\n\r\nSample Decomposition of Image into its Principal Components\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we plot the first two principal components against each other for each contestants, we see an interesting pattern emerge. It appears that winners (red) and runners-up (yellow) occupy two different clusters. It will be interesting to see if this cluster holds in future seasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Regression Results\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe number of tweets a contestant received the week before an episode aired effectively predicted whether the contestant would be eliminated from the show in that episode.  Our linear regression model indicated that 'tweet_share', the variable for a contestant's number of tweets during the previous week, had a very high coefficient for all weeks.  The other variables' coefficients were consistently near zero.  \r\n\r\nBelow is a histogram of results for Week 6, indicating that the coefficient for 'tweet_share' is near 25.\r\n\r\nHowever, the FCC economic area group of bachelor and contestant hometowns were not effective predictor variables for which contestant would not be eliminated from an episode.  In our linear regression models for each week of the Seasons, the FCC economic area group coefficient was near zero.  \r\n\r\nWe ran a linear regression models for each week, for all Seasons, to check whether the distances between the Bachelor's hometown and the Contestants' hometowns were effective predictors of who would not be eliminated.  For each week, the coefficient for the distance variable was almost zero.  Distance between hometowns is not an important factor for predicting True Love.\r\n\r\nWe made several statistical models to assess which factors best predicted winning contestants.  First, we ran linear regression models using the wikipedia background and twitter data as variables, to predict which contestants would not be eliminated.  We made one model for each week of the Season, for all Seasons.  So, for example, the model for \"week 1\" consisted of week 1 data for Seasons 13 to 19. \r\n\r\n(add more description on models)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe scraped data from Wikipedia, including age, hometown, profession, the week the contestant   was eliminated from the show, and whether the contestant received a first impression rose or a rose during a date.  Then we got the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) regional economic areas of hometowns, and International Standard Classification of Occupation (ISCO) profession classifications for professions.  \r\n\r\nWe also scraped Twitter for the number of tweets that each contestant got during each week of a Season, and the positive or negative sentiment of those tweets.  Finally, we did Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on each contestant's photograph.  We could only find comparable contestant photos for Seasons 13 to 19.  So, we decided to limit our analysis to those Seasons.\r\n\r\nClassification\r\n\r\nOf all the background variables - hometown, age, profession, number of tweets, receipt of roses during the show, and photographs - the most effective predictor, by far, was the number of tweets.  Below we consider each of the variables we used to predict contestant success on The Bachelor.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Photo Credits \r\n1) Red rose: 'red red rose' by Nick Klein, available through Creative Commons on Flickr, at \r\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/kleinnick/6178147928/in/photolist-apWC8S-2MYJCy-4Srzds-9ya54M-35U6Xn-7cPmAx-2bV2sQ-6qvHJq-3pxynJ-8kNPJb-8L9s15-6Gr3s9-4DQ8z8-5Pngcs-5EUH7A-6qvHQy-7j7dbY-3kGsn1-5KnmfK-8GtaoF-888DUv-9WxYx-8tgGxC-4T1nyW-6jmtYU-sZ1L-8WVDhz-61h6CS-7DaDXj-4JQojh-43Eqkf-8GwjPL-am3Tov-9nn79w-9joq3q-9GGWyv-ufhaFi-a3Twk-3QZC5-bw98b4-8Gt9M8-ns3YsC-95RjJc-7Ae5JN-rba6bf-4UhqTA-6kPiaW-3ceyBR-6H7KTb-4SZVaZ\r\n\r\n2) Table with candles and roses: 'rustic table' by www.proflowers.com, available through Creative Commons on Flickr, at https://www.flickr.com/photos/proflowers/16619803106/.\r\n\r\n3) FCC Economic areas:, \"Economic Area Groupings\", at http://transition.fcc.gov/oet/info/maps/areas/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
