        <p>Hi all! Let&#39;s use this repo for our CS109 project. I figured this would be the best way to reach MR, since emails were not provided. Let&#39;s meet this week.</p>

        <p>Project Overview</p>

<p>Reality TV has become a staple of modern popular culture.  ABC's popular TV show The Bachelor garners millions of viewers each week.  Even under the guise of "reality" and "true love", we hypothesize that there exist underlying patterns that in general enhance a contestant's chance of winning.  To simulate this "game of love", we create a dynamic model that is updated each week of the competition that predicts contestant's chance of winning.</p>

<p>Background</p>

<p>The Bachelor is a competition based reality TV show. Each season, about 30 women vie for a wedding proposal of a single Bachelor. Each week several women are eliminated until one contestant wins. To determine which contestants stay and which are eliminated, each week the Bachelor selects only a few contestant's to accompany him on a one-on-one or group date. At the end of the episode, there is a cocktail party where the Bachelor meets with any contestants who were not given a date during the episode. Finally, the episode closes with a rose ceremony where the Bachelor chooses who will proceed to the next episode by extending to them a rose.</p>

<p>Objective</p>

<p>We analyze underlying features of all winning and losing contestants on the The Bachelor. Using these data, we build a statistical model to predict week-by-week success on the TV show.</p>
